| **38** | Will take a break to work on mini projects |
| **39** | Started from course begining along with mini projects |
| **40** | Read some articles from external sources | 
| **41** | Started reading about Deep Image Re-Synthesis { Gaze Manipulation } | Will continue on the same | 
| **42** | Finished half the article | will finish the rest |
| **43** | Made sense of the article| Will Start with implementation |
| **44** | Started with the architecture, understood and split the modules to be implemented | Start with part 1|
| **45** | Working on first part extracting image part from eye | Sorting out some issues |
| **46** | Sorting the issues, learned so many things till now (Overall it's an amazing Experience) | learn more about it |  
| **47** | fixing bugs, learning more about extracting parts of images | To be Continued |
| **48** | Still working on the same project and looking and Mish functions by DIGANTA | Will read more about it from documentation | 
| **49** | Took a break from material, looked over external stuff, EchoAI | 
| **50** | Reading paper on Monocular Gaze Correction Using ML https://bit.ly/31Rcdvg which has connection to my project | continued |
| **51** | Read this amazing article on gan's https://medium.com/@devnag/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-in-50-lines-of-code-pytorch-e81b79659e3f by Dev Nag | continued |
